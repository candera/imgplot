* Overview

The idea behind this project is to load an image and then turn it into
various gcode paths that might be interesting, like something that
sort of sketches it in halftones with hash marks or wiggles or
whatever. Also to play with JavaFX.

* Hacking

Had to download the JavaFX SDK from [[https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/][here]].

** To Run
